# quotations

Funny quotations that may actually be true.

## Structure

The root directory hosts all static files that are available at the [website](https://sgade.github.io/quotations/). These files can be edited, as long as they are not generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Hugo generates its files from the definitions in the `src` directory.
There, `layouts/index.html` defines the structure of the page.
The `data` subdirectory holds relevant data.

## Updating quotes

All quotes are stored in `Quotations.yml` (in `data`). Each quotation is an item in the enumeration. Updates and changes should only be made in the data file.

## Publishing changes

After changing files within the `src` directory, **do not forget to call hugo**:

```bash
hugo
```

This generates all updates. Please commit those generated files in the root directory as well because they will be hosted that way using GitHub Pages.
